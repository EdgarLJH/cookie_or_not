Cookie or not?

This repository contains a CSV file of my cookie ingredient dataset and a Ipynb file of my code for analysis.

## Assumptions:

- Basic ingredients are: fat (butter), eggs, sugar, flour
- Basic ingredients are the only ingredients
- Fancy add-ons in recipes do not affect amount of basin ingredients
- All recipes reported yield same-sized cookies/biscuits 
- Granulated sugar = 250 g/cup; caster sugar = 240 g/cup; brown sugar = 245 g /cup
- 1:1:1 weight for self-raising, plain and all-purpose flour
- All eggs same size
- Idga* what type of cookie - whichever websites come up first on Google
